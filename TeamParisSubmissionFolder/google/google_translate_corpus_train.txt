Today mom died.
Or maybe yesterday, I do not know.
I asked for two days off to my boss and he could not refuse me with such excuse.
Rather, it was up to him to offer condolences.
But it will probably after tomorrow, when he sees me in mourning.
For the moment, it's as if Mom was not dead.
After the funeral, on the contrary, it will be a done deal and all have put a more formal look.
I took the bus to two hours.
When I left, they accompanied me to the door.
He lost his uncle, there are a few months.
