Mom died today. 
Or maybe it was yesterday, I don't know. 
I asked my boss for two days off, and with such an excuse, it was not possible for him to refuse.
Rather he should be the one to offer his condolences. 
But he will surely do so after-tomorrow, when he sees me mourning. 
For now, it's almost as if Mom wasn't dead.
After the funeral, on the contrary, it will be a closed case, and it will all have taken a more official appearance. 
I took the bus at 2 o'clock.
When I left, they accompanied me to the door.
He lost his uncle a couple months ago. 
I ran in order to catch the bus. 
When she lived at home, Mom would spend her time silently following me with her eyes. 
The first couple days she spent at the institute she would often cry. 
That's sort of the reason why I almost never visited in the past year. 
He had beautiful eyes, light blue, and a slightly red tint.
