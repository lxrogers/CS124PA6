Mother died today. 
Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure.
I have fixed up with my employer for two days’ leave; obviously, under the circumstances, he couldn’t refuse. 
It was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth.
Probably he will do so the day after tomorrow, when he sees me in black.
For the present, it’s almost as if Mother weren’t really dead.
The funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so to speak.
I took the two-o’clock bus.
When I left they came with me to the door.
He lost his uncle a few months ago.
I had to run to catch the bus.
When we lived together, Mother was always watching me, but we hardly ever talked. 
During her first few weeks at the Home she used to cry a good deal. 
That was why, during the last year, I seldom went to see her.
He was a pleasant-looking man, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks.
